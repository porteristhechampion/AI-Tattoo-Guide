# Porter Taylor Weekly Journal

Week 1 - 1/26/25
Time Spent: 5 hours (rough estimate)

I am writing this journal entry after the fact so these are mostly rough estimates and I may be forgetting things.
Week 1 consisted of setting up my development environment which was for the most pretty easy. I did run into some
issues where I had to change my path variable in my system environment since I had originally changed it when
working with WSL for a different class. Other than that everything was fairly straight forward and I configured
everything in intelliJ and learned how to run a tomcat server through intelliJ to finish off the week.

Week 2 - 2/2/25
Time Spent: 6 hours (rough estimate)

I am writing this journal entry after the fact so these are mostly rough estimates and I may be forgetting things.
I treated week 2 as more of a review of Adv Java since it has been over a year since I have touched Java at all. I
struggled quite a bit with the exercise and had to go back multiple times and look at my final project from Adv Java.
I also spent a long time deciding on what individual project I wanted to do and even wrote some code to determine if
it was going to be a project I was able to do on my own since I have only worked with APIs in Adv JavaScript. It was
also my 21st birthday this week, so I did zero work on Thursday, Friday and Saturday since I spent the days with my
family and in Steven's Point visiting friends which caused a bit of a grind on Sunday.

Week 3 - 2/9/25
Time Spent: 1 hour

I was sick for most of this week and was unable to do much work for this course. I mostly focused on watching the
videos and doing the readings for this week.

Week 4 - 2/16/25
Time Spent: 3-4 hours

I was still sick for most of this week but was able to get some work done on the weekend. I mostly worked on the week 3
exercise and didn't focus much on my indie project and am currently working through the indie project checkpoint 1. I
struggled with time management after I started feeling better but really enjoyed working with tests. I thought the advent
of code puzzle was fun and plan on working on the week 3 challenge tomorrow. My plan for tonight is to finish up my
indie project checkpoint.

Week 5 - 2/23/25
Time Spent: 6 hours (rough estimate, could've been longer)

I spent most of this week playing catch up and finished my first version of my project plan and spent time working on the
week 3 challenge. The week 3 challenge was pretty fun to work on and through week 6 I am going back and taking time to better
plan out my indie project. I wanted to just start coding, but I am having a hard time getting started since my plan isn't
very thorough.

Week 6 - 3/2/25
Time Spent: 13 hours (3 hours for project plan, 1 hour for code review)

I spent a lot of this week going back and better adjusting my project plan to make future progress more efficiently. I ended
up writing out my DAO before I looked forward to hibernate which was a big mistake since I had to go back and wipe out all of
my progress and restart using hibernate. I properly adjusted my Suggestion entity using hibernate and am currently working on
testing my new DAO that uses hibernate. I also met with Alex, and we did a code review together. Alex was very kind and
helpful and gave me some advice and shared some things that he struggled with during the development of his project. I wrote
out my code review on Sunday and will turn that in today. I also want to completely finish testing and developing my DAO, so
I can focus on deploying my project to AWS the rest of the week.
