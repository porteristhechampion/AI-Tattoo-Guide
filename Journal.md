# Porter Taylor Weekly Journal

Week 1 - 1/26/25
Time Spent: 5 hours (rough estimate)

I am writing this journal entry after the fact so these are mostly rough estimates and I may be forgetting things.
Week 1 consisted of setting up my development environment which was for the most pretty easy. I did run into some
issues where I had to change my path variable in my system environment since I had originally changed it when
working with WSL for a different class. Other than that everything was fairly straight forward and I configured
everything in intelliJ and learned how to run a tomcat server through intelliJ to finish off the week.

Week 2 - 2/2/25
Time Spent: 6 hours (rough estimate)

I am writing this journal entry after the fact so these are mostly rough estimates and I may be forgetting things.
I treated week 2 as more of a review of Adv Java since it has been over a year since I have touched Java at all. I
struggled quite a bit with the exercise and had to go back multiple times and look at my final project from Adv Java.
I also spent a long time deciding on what individual project I wanted to do and even wrote some code to determine if
it was going to be a project I was able to do on my own since I have only worked with APIs in Adv JavaScript. It was
also my 21st birthday this week, so I did zero work on Thursday, Friday and Saturday since I spent the days with my
family and in Steven's Point visiting friends which caused a bit of a grind on Sunday.

Week 3 - 2/9/25
Time Spent: 1 hour

I was sick for most of this week and was unable to do much work for this course. I mostly focused on watching the
videos and doing the readings for this week.

Week 4 - 2/16/25
Time Spent: 3-4 hours

I was still sick for most of this week but was able to get some work done on the weekend. I mostly worked on the week 3
exercise and didn't focus much on my indie project and am currently working through the indie project checkpoint 1. I
struggled with time management after I started feeling better but really enjoyed working with tests. I thought the advent
of code puzzle was fun and plan on working on the week 3 challenge tomorrow. My plan for tonight is to finish up my
indie project checkpoint.

Week 5 - 2/23/25
Time Spent: 6 hours (rough estimate, could've been longer)

I spent most of this week playing catch up and finished my first version of my project plan and spent time working on the
week 3 challenge. The week 3 challenge was pretty fun to work on and through week 6 I am going back and taking time to better
plan out my indie project. I wanted to just start coding, but I am having a hard time getting started since my plan isn't
very thorough.

Week 6 - 3/2/25
Time Spent: 13 hours (3 hours for project plan, 1 hour for code review)

I spent a lot of this week going back and better adjusting my project plan to make future progress more efficiently. I ended
up writing out my DAO before I looked forward to hibernate which was a big mistake since I had to go back and wipe out all of
my progress and restart using hibernate. I properly adjusted my Suggestion entity using hibernate and am currently working on
testing my new DAO that uses hibernate. I also met with Alex, and we did a code review together. Alex was very kind and
helpful and gave me some advice and shared some things that he struggled with during the development of his project. I wrote
out my code review on Sunday and will turn that in today. I also want to completely finish testing and developing my DAO, so
I can focus on deploying my project to AWS the rest of the week.

Week 7 - 3/9/25
Time Spent: 5 hours (rough estimate)

I'm writing this after the fact since I am a few weeks behind on my journal but this week I mainly worked on fully completing
my DAO. I finished around 90% of it and got most of it tested. Writing this during week 9 I still have some adjustments to make
but the bulk of it was finished in this week. I also did a code review with Adam this week, we both met up and showed what
progress we currently had on our projects. Meeting with Adam was nice because we were able to share what we were struggling with
to give each other a better insight into how to finish our projects.


Week 8 - 3/16/25
Time Spent: 3 hours (rough estimate)
I'm writing this after the fact since I am a few weeks behind on my journal but this week I mainly worked on fixing and adding to
the tests for my DAO. I had missed some things and I fixed a decent amount of them but as of week 9 I still have a few things to
finish up. I didn't spend much time this week on this course compared to past weeks since I had kind of a busy week.


Week 9 - 3/30/25
Time Spent: 5 hours
Week 9 included spring break, and I'm writing this on 3/28. I didn't do much during spring break, but I did adjust my unit tests
so they would not be interfered with prior entries into the database and that is all working properly. After submitting them again
I still have some things to add, but I'm happy with where they are at right now and will go back to adjust them later. Week 9 also 
was the start of our team project and I spent a good chunk of time working on that as well which is not included in the time spent.
I rewrote my OpenAI class using the RoboPOJO generator and that is all finished and working as expected. My plan right now is to
finish my unit testing, and then get a very rough template for my jsps. I don't have a lot of experience with AWS, and I've heard from
other students that they have been getting charged a little bit for it. They haven't been getting charged a lot, but because of my lack
of experience I want to make sure that I have a working project I can upload, so I can spend as little time as possible with it deployed.
Once I finish my unit testing and have a rough working example with my jsps I will deploy my project to AWS and work on getting cognito
setup, then adjust formatting to create a final result and once I have all of that finished my project will be completed.

Week 10 - 4/6/25
Time Spent: 2 hours
I didn't spend very much time on my indie project this week and spent most of the time working on the team project. I mostly just
worked on perfecting my unit tests, and I'm getting SUPER close to finishing that. I will hopefully have more time to work on my
indie project in the next few weeks, and I am feeling very confident that I will be able to finish it all up moving forward.

Week 11 - 4/13/25
Time Spent: 1 hour
I was mainly focused on the team project this week. I adjusted my test classes a little bit to better test what happens to the user
entity when a suggestion is deleted. I also filled out some journal entries.

Week 12 - 4/20/25
Time Spent: None
I didn't spend any time on the indie project this week and only focused on the team project.

Week 13 - 4/27/25
Time Spent: 11 hours
So far this week I have been working on adding my first version of my jsps. I finished all of that and the application now has all the
finished features for the user minus the login and register features since I haven't deployed to AWS yet. I would like to get the admin
feature finished, and then I will be doing the open-source challenge on Sunday, hopefully. I also have an offline code review with Alison
which will probably take place tomorrow. I'm feeling very confident with where I am at right now since I have roughly a week and a half to
two weeks to get the AWS and cognito stuff setup, so I'm feeling great. I also added the admin page where admins can view a list of the 
users and delete a user if needed which will in turn delete all the suggestions associated with that user. I think a nice feature to have
would be to search for a specific user using a username on the admin page, but I don't think I will get to that in this class and for now
ctrl + f will have to do.

Week 14 - 5/5/25
Time Spent: 5 hours
This week I deployed my application to AWS. There isn't really a ton to talk about since it wasn't difficult it just took awhile. I had a
good amount of experience doing something similar since we did it in the team project, but I am glad I got it working since it was one of 
the things I was most nervous about with this project. I have spent a little bit of time trying to get cognito going and I don't currently
have it properly implemented into the exercise. In good news I am finished with my other classwork so the next full week will go into the
indie project.

Week 15 - 5/12/25
Time Spent: 8 hours
This week I fully implemented cognito and admin authentication functionalities. I then went back and made some corrections and also updated
the UI to make it more appealing using bootstrap. I am very happy to be finished and I had quite a bit of fun working on this project. Prior
to this class I hated Web Development, but I would say that the front end work on this project was by far the most fun and rewarding. After
12 weeks of just working on the backend it was really rewarding to see actual displayed data and get to play around with my application. I
am pleased with how the application turned out and eventually would like to create a V2 that is able to generate images!
